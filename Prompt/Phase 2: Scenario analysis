#                      SCENARIO FORECAST PROTOCOL: PHASE 2
# ==============================================================================
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  CONTEXT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You are executing Phase 2 of a 7-phase protocol.
# GOAL: To conduct a wide-ranging environmental scan to identify a comprehensive
# list of potential events, trends, risks, and opportunities that could
# significantly impact the company's valuation within the investment horizon.
# CURRENT PHASE OBJECTIVE: Brainstorm and list all potential drivers of change.
# This phase prioritizes quantity and breadth; filtering and prioritization will
# occur in later phases.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                       CORE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (REINFORCEMENT)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You MUST apply the framework established in Phase 1 for this analysis. To ensure
# precision, re-confirm your adherence to the following rules:
# - Severity Scale (1-10): Quantifies the potential valuation impact of an event.
# - Lexicon of Likelihood (Tiers 1-6): Defines the probability of an event.
# - Sources & Validation Framework ([T1]/[T2]/[T3]): Your identified trends must be
#   grounded in plausible signals from this source hierarchy.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                 COMMAND: PHASE 2
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Your primary task is to identify and catalogue a comprehensive list of potential
# future events, trends, risks, and opportunities relevant to the company and
# its investment thesis.
#
# 1. Analyze the full context from Phase 1 (Company, Thesis, SWOT).
# 2. Systematically scan across the following domains to identify potential drivers:
#    - Geopolitical & Regulatory
#    - Macroeconomic
#    - Market & Industry (including supply chain)
#    - Technological
#    - Competitor Landscape
#    - Social & Public Perception
#    - Company-Specific (e.g., potential leadership changes, R&D milestones)
#    - Black swan events
# 3. For each identified driver, you must classify and assess it according to the
#    output format specified below.
# 4. CRITICAL: Do not summarize or internally filter the list. The goal is to
#    be exhaustive. Capture both high-probability trends and low-probability "tail risks."

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Present your findings as a structured list. For each item, provide the following
# data points in a clear, consistent format.

# FORMAT:
# **[Event / Trend Name]**
# - **Category:** [Geopolitical, Macroeconomic, Market, Technological, etc.]
# - **Type:** [Threat / Opportunity]
# - **Description:** [A brief, one-sentence explanation of the event and its potential impact.]
# - **Severity:** [1-10]
# - **Likelihood:** [Tier 1-6]
# - **Trajectory:** [Gaining / Fading / Stable / Emergent]
# - **Impact Window:** [The timeframe for the event's primary impact, e.g., "Next 18 months", "3-5 years"]

# EXAMPLE:
# **New US/China Tariffs on Semiconductors**
# - **Category:** Geopolitical & Regulatory
# - **Type:** Threat
# - **Description:** The imposition of new, broad-based tariffs on semiconductor imports/exports could disrupt the company's supply chain and increase production costs.
# - **Severity:** 8
# - **Likelihood:** Tier 4
# - **Trajectory:** Gaining
# - **Impact Window:** Next 12 months

# Once you have generated the complete list, state the following verbatim:
# "Phase 2 is complete. The comprehensive list of potential drivers has been generated. Please confirm to proceed to Phase 3: Event Tree."

## Sentiment Analysis scoring



# Output
| Category     |  Current scoring | Worst Case | Base case | Best case |
| Brand value  | 87               | 43         | 67        | 90        |
| Green policy | 60               | 20         | 55        | 57        |

Worst-case reasoning: 
"Drops in worst case due to leadership turmoil post-Event B; rises in best case from proactive transparency..."

Base-Case reasoning:
"Damaged in worst due to environmental event fallout; improved in best from regulatory leadership..."

Best-Case reasoning:
"Best case includes successful product launch; worst includes R&D cuts..."

### Scoring Guidelines
| Category | 100% (Ultra Rare Ideal) | 70–80% (Best in Class) | 40–60% (Competitive) | 1–20% (Subpar) | 0% (Absent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Competitive Advantage | Global market leader with unassailable, world-exclusive patents, regulatory barriers, & contractual lock-ins. | Strong proprietary IP and regional exclusivity. | Differentiated offering but easily replicated. | Narrow edge; few real barriers. | No defensible advantage. |
| Management Quality | Flawless track record: zero turnover, 100% equity-aligned comp, pristine insider conduct, global network. | Visionary, stable leadership with high equity link. | Competent team; occasional churn or misalignment. | Frequent turnover, opaque comp. | Dysfunctional or misaligned. |
| Industry Trends | Catapults new narratives; sets regulation & ESG standards industry-wide. | Actively shapes major partnerships & standards. | Participates in trends; limited leadership. | Token efforts; reactive. | Completely off-narrative. |
| Risk (inverted) | Zero legal, regulatory, geopolitical, or reputational exposure across all markets. | Low risk profile; robust compliance programs. | Moderate, manageable exposures. | Major unresolved issues. | Severe sanctions or litigation. |
| Financial Resilience | Unquestionable cash fortress: multi-year runway, zero burn, diversified non-dilutive funding. | High liquidity & secured grants/contracts. | Mixed liquidity; watch-list. | Thin buffer; cash burn warning. | Critically undercapitalized. |

Concise reasoning for each score, citing specific evidence from approved sources (e.g., NATO certifications, patent numbers, ITAR compliance status, market share reports).
A sector-relative benchmark (e.g., "Its brand trust is higher than regional competitors but lags behind global leader DJI.").
A note on data gaps or ambiguities that affect your confidence in the score.
Conclude with the question: "Do you approve of this analysis for Competitive Advantage? If so, we will proceed to Category 2: Industry Trends."



# Output
| Category     |  Current scoring | Worst Case | Base case | Best case |
| Brand value  | 87               | 43         | 67        | 90        |
| Green policy | 60               | 20         | 55        | 57        |

Worst-case reasoning: 
"Drops in worst case due to leadership turmoil post-Event B; rises in best case from proactive transparency..."

Base-Case reasoning:
"Damaged in worst due to environmental event fallout; improved in best from regulatory leadership..."

Best-Case reasoning:
"Best case includes successful product launch; worst includes R&D cuts..."

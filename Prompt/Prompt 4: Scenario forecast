# CONTEXT
You are initiating Phase 4 of a 5-phase protocol.
You are in the process of forecasting the valuation of a company by using industry and economic data points to perform a scenario forecast. 

# Task
Your task is to finalize the scenario forecast based on the previous finding, with a monte-carlo simulation to vary out biases.
The objective with the scenario forecast is to narrow down to a worst case, base case, and best case scenario. 

# Command
**Step 1** 
Use the event tree structure and trigger logic from Prompt 4 as the simulation backbone.
Use the monte-carlo simulations, with 1.000.000 trials. In each trial:
- Sample event occurrences based on their base and conditional probabilities.
- Calculate the combined effect on independent variables.
- Feed these changes into the multiple logistic regression model (from Prompt 1) to simulate impact on the dependent variable (e.g., company classification, stock performance).

**Step 2** 
Select the representative scenarios for each case:
- Worst case: bottom 5% 
- Base case: central tendency (Median value)
- Best case: top 5%

# Output
- Forecasted multiple logistic regression chart to the end year of the investment timeframe
- Display the sequence of events that define the specific scenario 
      - Event name
      - Timeframe
      - Compound probability
      - Trigger dependencies and conditional probabilities 
- Narrative explanation: Describe the reasoning behind the scenario, the assumptions, and what signals will indicate the scenario is happening.
- Stock price
    - Expected % change in the stock price from today until end of investment time frame in the scenario
    - Forecasted chart of the stock price movement.

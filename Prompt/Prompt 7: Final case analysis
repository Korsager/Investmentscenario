#      SCENARIO FORECAST PROTOCOL: PHASE 7 (MONTE CARLO SYNTHESIS & FINAL VERDICT)
# ==============================================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  PERSONA
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Your role is the Chief Investment Officer, responsible for the final synthesis.
# You must distill all prior analysis, including competing scenarios, into a
# single, definitive, and actionable forecast.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  CONTEXT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the final analytical phase of the protocol.
# GOAL: To synthesize the primary forecast (Phase 5) and the contrarian "Red Team"
# challenge (Phase 6) into a new, single set of "Most Probable" scenarios for
# the Worst, Base, and Best cases.
# METHODOLOGY: You will not run a literal simulation. Instead, you will act as
# an expert interpreting the results of a hypothetical 100,000-path Monte Carlo
# simulation. Your task is to describe the "central tendency" or the most
# frequently occurring cluster of outcomes for each of the three main scenarios.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#             CORE FRAMEWORK: DOMINANT NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Your synthesis will be guided by the following logic:

# 1.  **Interpret the Simulation's "Center of Gravity":** A Monte Carlo
#     simulation on these inputs would generate thousands of outcome paths. Your
#     task is to identify the most plausible "dominant narrative" for each of the
#     three worlds (Worst, Base, Best) by blending the possibilities from
#     Phase 5 and Phase 6.

# 2.  **Construct the "Most Probable" Scenarios:** For each case (Worst, Base, Best),
#     you must:
#     a.  **Compare and Contrast:** Analyze the corresponding scenarios from Phase 5
#         (the primary forecast) and Phase 6 (the Red Team challenge).
#     b.  **Synthesize a New Narrative:** Create a single, new, more nuanced narrative
#         that logically combines the most credible elements from both phases. For
#         example, the `Most Probable Worst Case` might be triggered by a "Red
#         Team" event but result in the impacts described in the "Primary" forecast.
#     c.  **Determine the Final Outcome:** Assign a new, single probability and
#         valuation impact to this synthesized scenario, justifying it as the most
#         likely central outcome.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                 COMMAND: PHASE 7
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.  Acknowledge your objective to synthesize the prior phases by interpreting
#     the results of a hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation.
# 2.  Following the "Dominant Narrative Synthesis" framework, create the three
#     new "Most Probable" scenarios.
# 3.  For each new scenario, you must show the underlying logic and calculations
#     that led to the synthesized outcome.
# 4.  Present your complete analysis using the EXACT `OUTPUT SPECIFICATION` below.
# 5.  Conclude by asking the user if they want a full, consolidated report.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Present your analysis as the final verdict of the entire protocol.

# ================================================================
#              FINAL VERDICT: MONTE CARLO SYNTHESIS
# ================================================================

# **Methodology Preamble:**
# The following scenarios represent the "most probable" outcomes, or the central
# tendency, derived from interpreting a hypothetical 100,000-path Monte Carlo
# simulation. This synthesis blends the primary forecast (Phase 5) with the
# contrarian Red Team analysis (Phase 6) to create a single, risk-adjusted view.

# ### **The Most Probable WORST CASE Scenario**

# **Synthesized Narrative:** [Write a new, compelling 1-2 paragraph narrative. This story should logically blend the most credible threat elements from BOTH Phase 5 and Phase 6 into a single, cohesive timeline of events.]

# * **Synthesis Logic:** This scenario is driven by the [e.g., "competitor breakthrough" from the Red Team analysis] but results in the [e.g., "severe supply chain disruption" and market share loss detailed in the primary forecast].
# * **Probabilistic Justification:** In a full simulation, this narrative represents the most frequent cluster of "worst-case" outcomes, as it combines a plausible (if low-probability) trigger with a well-defined set of impacts.
# * **Calculation & Final Outcome:**
#     - `Synthesized Probability = [e.g., 20%]`
#     - `Synthesized Valuation Impact = [e.g., -45%]`

# ---

# ### **The Most Probable BASE CASE Scenario**

# **Synthesized Narrative:** [Write a new narrative for the most likely "middle ground" future. This should incorporate the most probable headwinds and tailwinds from both the primary and contrarian analyses, resulting in a realistic, nuanced path forward.]

# * **Synthesis Logic:** This scenario assumes the [e.g., "continued market growth from the primary forecast"] but acknowledges the [e.g., "brand commoditization risk identified by the Red Team"], leading to slower margin growth than initially projected.
# * **Probabilistic Justification:** This narrative represents the densest cluster of outcomes in a simulation, reflecting a "muddle-through" reality where neither the most extreme risks nor opportunities fully materialize.
# * **Calculation & Final Outcome:**
#     - `Synthesized Probability = [e.g., 55%]`
#     - `Synthesized Valuation Impact = [e.g., +15%]`

# ---

# ### **The Most Probable BEST CASE Scenario**

# **Synthesized Narrative:** [Write a new, optimistic but realistic narrative. This story might combine a key opportunity from the primary forecast with the successful navigation of a contrarian threat, showing resilience and strategic acumen.]

# * **Synthesis Logic:** This scenario is triggered by the company successfully [e.g., "capturing the new market outlined in the primary forecast"], and it is amplified by its ability to [e.g., "pivot and monetize a secondary asset," an idea surfaced in the Red Team analysis].
# * **Probabilistic Justification:** While less frequent, this narrative represents the center of the positive outcomes in a simulation, where strategic success is defined by both capturing opportunity and mitigating deep risks.
# * **Calculation & Final Outcome:**
#     - `Synthesized Probability = [e.g., 25%]`
#     - `Synthesized Valuation Impact = [e.g., +70%]`

# **Final Command:**

# Having completed the full 7-phase analysis, would you like me to compile an in-depth research report containing the outputs from Phase 2 through Phase 7?

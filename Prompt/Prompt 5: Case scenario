#                      SCENARIO FORECAST PROTOCOL: PHASE 5
# ==============================================================================
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  CONTEXT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You are executing phase 5 out of a 7-phase protocol.
# GOAL: To synthesize all data from Phases 1-4 into three coherent, narrative
# scenarios that provide a clear forecast for the company's valuation. This final
# report will guide strategic investment decisions.
# CURRENT PHASE OBJECTIVE: Construct the Best, Base, and Worst-Case scenarios,
# assess the current trajectory, and provide a strategic recommendation.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                    CORE FRAMEWORK: SCENARIO CONSTRUCTION LOGIC
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You will now construct the three scenarios by weaving together the Causal Chains
# from Phase 3. Use the following logic:

# 1.  **Worst Case Scenario (The "Thanatos World"):**
#     - This narrative is defined by the materialization of the most severe **Threat** Causal Chains identified in Phase 3.
#     - It assumes that key negative risks manifest and opportunities fail to materialize.

# 2.  **Best Case Scenario (The "Alpha World"):**
#     - This narrative is defined by the materialization of the most impactful **Opportunity** Causal Chains.
#     - It assumes the company successfully navigates threats and captures significant upside.

# 3.  **Base Case Scenario (The "Continuum World"):**
#     - This narrative is the most probable future. It is not "no change," but rather a realistic mix.
#     - Construct it using the highest probability (Tier 1-2) events and chains, incorporating both expected headwinds (minor threats) and tailwinds (minor opportunities) from your analysis.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                 COMMAND: PHASE 5
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.  Review all data from Phases 1-4.
# 2.  First, provide an **"Assessment of Current Trajectory."** Based on the signals you analyzed in Phase 4, state which of the three scenarios our current path seems to be leaning towards and why.
# 3.  Next, build the three scenarios (Worst, Base, Best) according to the construction logic defined above.
# 4.  For each scenario, you must write a compelling narrative and present the full analysis using the EXACT `OUTPUT SPECIFICATION` below.
# 5.  Finally, conclude with a **"Strategic Recommendation & Positioning"** section that outlines the implications for an investor's portfolio based on the complete analysis.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Present your final analysis as a complete strategic report.

#                       STRATEGIC SCENARIO FORECAST
# ================================================================

# **Assessment of Current Trajectory:**
# [Provide a 2-4 sentence analysis of which world (Worst, Base, Best) the current signals from Phase 4 are pointing towards and why.]
#
# ---
#
# ### **Scenario 1: Worst Case**
#
# **Narrative:** [Write a compelling 1-2 paragraph story of this future. Describe how the world evolves, how the key negative events unfold, and what the impact on the company's operations, market position, and investor sentiment is.]
#
# - **Defining Causal Chain:** [State the name of the primary "Threat" chain from Phase 3 that drives this scenario.]
# - **Final Outcome:** Probability: [Chain's Final Probability (20%-40%)] | Valuation Change: [Estimate final potential valuation change, e.g., "0% to -20%".]
# - **Key Signals Indicating This Path:**
#   - **Signal 1:** [Copy the key signal to watch from Phase 4.]
#   - **Signal 2:** [Copy the second key signal to watch from Phase 4.]
#
# ---
#
# ### **Scenario 2: Base Case**
#
# **Narrative:** [Write a compelling 1-2 paragraph story of this future. Describe a realistic path forward, incorporating the most probable positive and negative events. Explain how the company manages expected challenges and executes on its core strategy.]
#
# - **Defining Causal Chain:** [State the name of the most probable causal chain(s) from Phase 3 that drive this scenario.]
# - **Final Outcome:** Probability: [Chain's Final Probability (20%-40%)] | Valuation Change: [Estimate final potential valuation change, e.g., "0% to -20%".]
# - **Key Signals Indicating This Path:**
#   - **Signal 1:** [Copy the key signal to watch from Phase 4 for this path.]
#   - **Signal 2:** [Copy the second key signal to watch from Phase 4 for this path.]
#
# ---
#
# ### **Scenario 3: Best Case**
#
# **Narrative:** [Write a compelling 1-2 paragraph story of this future. Describe how key opportunities are seized, how threats are neutralized or avoided, and how this leads to outsized growth and a fundamental re-rating of the company by the market.]
#
# - **Defining Causal Chain:** [State the name of the primary "Opportunity" chain from Phase 3 that drives this scenario.]
# - **Final Outcome:** Probability: [Chain's Final Probability (20%-40%)] | Valuation Change: [Estimate final potential valuation change, e.g., "0% to -20%".]
# - **Key Signals Indicating This Path:**
#   - **Signal 1:** [Copy the key signal to watch from Phase 4 for this path.]
#   - **Signal 2:** [Copy the second key signal to watch from Phase 4 for this path.]
#
# ---
#
# ### **Strategic Recommendation & Positioning**
#
# Based on the comprehensive analysis, here are the strategic implications:
# - **Current Position:** Given that the current trajectory leans towards the **[Name of World]**, a **[Hold / Cautiously Accumulate / Trim Position]** stance is warranted.
# - **Triggers for Action:**
#   - **To Increase Position (Buy):** Monitor the signals for the **Alpha World**. If [Key Signal 1 for Best Case] and [Key Signal 2 for Best Case] both confirm, it indicates a fundamental upside catalyst is materializing.
#   - **To Decrease Position (Sell):** Monitor the signals for the **Thanatos World**. If [Key Signal 1 for Worst Case] confirms, it serves as a critical early warning to protect capital. A confirmation of [Key Signal 2 for Worst Case] would suggest an urgent exit.

# Once you have generated the complete report, state the following verbatim:
# "Phase 5 is complete. Please confirm to proceed to the 6 phase, Phase 6: Red Team Challenge."

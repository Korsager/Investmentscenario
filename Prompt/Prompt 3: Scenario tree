# Context
You are initiating Phase 3 of a 5-phase protocol.
You are in the process of forecasting the valuation of a company by using industry and economic data points to perform a scenario forecast. 

# Task
Building on the previous prompts (logistic regression modeling and risk/event impact analysis), your task now is to create a scenario tree that:
- Maps the sequence and interdependencies of the 50 identified risks, trends, and events over the investment horizon.
- Quantifies trigger relationships, compound probabilities, and cascading effects between events.
- Provides a structured forecast of plausible event chains and their potential impact on the dependent variable.

# Command
**Step 1**
Assign all the scenarios a base probability of occurrence (estimated using historical data, market intelligence, or Bayesian reasoning), and an ID.

**Step 2** 
Analyze causal links: Which events could trigger or increase the probability of others?
Example: "Geopolitical sanctions on China (Event A) increase the likelihood of a semiconductor supply chain disruption (Event B) in Q2 2026."
  For each trigger link, assign a conditional probability (e.g., P(B | A) = 30%).
  For each event chain, compute the compound probability:
  Example: P(A) = 40%
  P(B | A) = 30%
  Compound: P(A ∩ B) = 0.4 × 0.3 = 12%
Estimate the cumulative impact on the dependent variable for each event path.

The *event sequence* can be of any length, but also has multiple events triggered at the same time. 
The *event sequence* timeline is from today until the end of the investment timeframe.
Create 20 scenario paths.

# Output
| Scenario Path | Event Sequence | Compound Probability (%) | Total Estimated Impact (%) | Trigger Explanation                            |
| Path 1        | A → B → D      | 12%                      | -15.4%                     | A increases chance of B by X% due to ...       |
| Path 2        | C → E          | 18%                      | -9.2%                      | C historically precedes E during policy shifts |
| Path 3        | C → E → D → B  | 18%                      | -9.2%                      | C historically precedes E during policy shifts |

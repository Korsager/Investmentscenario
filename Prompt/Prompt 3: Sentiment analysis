#                      SCENARIO FORECAST PROTOCOL: PHASE 3
# ==============================================================================
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  CONTEXT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You are executing Phase 3 of a 7-phase protocol.
# GOAL: To transform the flat list of drivers from Phase 2 into logical "Causal
# Chains." These chains will model how a primary event can trigger a sequence of
# subsequent events, forming the backbone of our final scenarios.
# CURRENT PHASE OBJECTIVE: Map the most critical event chains, calculating their
# cumulative probability and impact on valuation.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                       CORE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (REINFORCEMENT)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This phase is driven by conditional probability. You MUST use the following rule,
# which was established in the initial protocol.

# **Conditional Probability Modifier:** This rule governs how the probability of
# a subsequent event changes after a preceding event occurs.
# - **Formula:** New Probability = Base Probability * (1 + Modifier)
# - **Modifier Scale (Your Guideline for Estimating the Modifier):**
#   - **Strong Causal Link (+0.6 to +0.9):** The first event is a direct and
#     primary cause of the second. (e.g., A specific new regulation directly
#     causes a product to be recalled).
#   - **Moderate Causal Link (+0.3 to +0.5):** The first event significantly
#     increases the likelihood of the second. (e.g., A recession makes a
#     competitor's bankruptcy more likely).
#   - **Weak Causal Link (+0.1 to +0.2):** The first event is a contributing
#     factor but not a primary cause. (e.g., General negative sentiment
#     slightly increases the chance of a critical article being published).

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                 COMMAND: PHASE 3
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.  **Select Key Drivers:** From the Phase 2 list, identify the 3-5 most
#     critical "Key Driver Events" to serve as the roots of your chains.
#     Prioritize events with high Severity (7+) and high Uncertainty (Likelihood
#     Tiers 3-5), as these represent the biggest risks and pivot points.
#
# 2.  **Build Causal Chains:** For each Key Driver, build a Causal Chain by
#     identifying a logical sequence of 2-4 subsequent events from the Phase 2 list.
#
# 3.  **Analyze and Document Each Chain:** For each chain, present your analysis
#     using the EXACT format specified in the Output Specification below.
#     - For each link in the chain, you must state the **Modifier** you are applying
#       and **show the calculation** for the new conditional probability.
#     - Track the **cumulative valuation impact** and **cumulative probability** at each step.
#
# 4.  **Apply Termination Conditions:** A chain's progression stops if:
#     a. The cumulative **valuation impact** meets or exceeds the **Max Drawdown
#        Tolerance** defined in Phase 1.
#     b. The chain extends beyond the **Investment Horizon** defined in Phase 1.
#     c. The chain reaches a logical conclusion after 3-5 steps.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Present each Causal Chain clearly, using indentation to show the sequence.

# EXAMPLE FORMAT:
# ### Causal Chain 1: Geopolitical Supply Chain Disruption
#
# **Root Event:** [Threat] Major Geopolitical Conflict in Key Supplier Region
# - **Base Analysis:** Severity: 9 | Likelihood: Tier 5 (15%) | Impact Window: 1-2 Years
# - **Chain Path:**
#   1.  **[Threat] Government imposes export ban on critical material.**
#       - *Causal Link:* Strong (Modifier: +0.8). The conflict makes an export ban highly probable.
#       - *Calculation:* New Likelihood = 15% * (1 + 0.8) = 27% (Moves to Tier 4).
#       - *Cumulative Impact:* **Valuation Impact: -20%** | **Chain Probability: 27%**
#   2.  **[Threat] Company experiences major production halt.**
#       - *Causal Link:* Strong (Modifier: +0.9). An export ban on a critical material directly causes production halts.
#       - *Calculation:* New Likelihood = 27% * (1 + 0.9) = 51.3% (Moves to Tier 2).
#       - *Cumulative Impact:* **Valuation Impact: -35%** | **Chain Probability: 51.3%**
#
# **Chain Summary:**
# - **Final Valuation Impact:** -35%
# - **Final Likelihood:** 51.3% (Probable)
# - **Termination Reason:** Max Drawdown Tolerance (20%) exceeded.

# "Phase 3 is complete. The primary Causal Chains have been mapped and analyzed. Please confirm to proceed to Phase 4: Signal & Sentiment."

# CONTEXT
You are initiating Phase 1 of a 5-phase protocol.
You are in the process of forecasting the valuation of a company by using industry and economic data points to perform a scenario forecast. 

#Task 
Your task is to perform a multiple logistic regression model to analyse the relation between the dependent dataset and the independent dataset, provided by the user.
Also, calculate the R-squared. 

# COMMAND 
**Step 1:**
Ask the user to provide an Excel or CSV file for the following dataset:
- Dependent value dataset
- Independent value dataset

/Execute **Step 2** when provided with data in **step 1**
**Step 2:**
Execute step 2 when the 2 files from **step 1** are provided.
Analyse the files to create a multiple regression chart. 
Provide the Pearson correlation coefficient value.

# Output
- Create a visual of a scatter plotter chart that represent the multiple logistic regression model (Must be one chart)
- Clearly state the Pearson R value 
- Create a table with the Pearson correlation coefficient value for each independent data
